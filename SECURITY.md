# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report vulnerabilities through GitHub Security Advisories (private reporting):

- <https://github.com/cracketus/senior-pomidor/security/advisories/new>

Do not open public GitHub issues for potential vulnerabilities.

When submitting a report, include:

- A clear description of the issue and impact
- Reproduction steps or proof of concept
- Affected versions/branches (if known)
- Suggested remediation (if available)

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are provided on a best-effort basis for:

- The default branch (`main`)
- The current release snapshot documented in `docs/releases/`

Older snapshots/branches may not receive security patches.

## Response Targets

Target service levels for private vulnerability reports:

- Initial acknowledgement: within 3 business days
- Triage and severity assessment: within 7 business days
- Ongoing status updates: at least every 14 days until resolution or accepted risk

These are best-effort targets, not guaranteed SLAs.

## Disclosure Process

1. Reporter submits privately through GitHub Security Advisories.
2. Maintainers validate, assess severity, and define a remediation path.
3. A fix is prepared and reviewed in private where needed.
4. Patch is released and disclosure notes are published when safe.
5. Advisory is updated with affected/fixed versions and mitigation guidance.
