## 🚀 Quick Start (90 seconds)

### Option A: Automatic (Recommended)
```powershell
# 1. Install GitHub CLI (one-time)
# → https://cli.github.com/

# 2. Authenticate (one-time)
gh auth login

# 3. Create all issues
cd C:\MyProjects\senior-pomidor
python scripts\create_github_issues.py
```

✅ Done! 10 issues created automatically.

### Option B: Dry-Run First
```powershell
python scripts\create_github_issues.py --dry-run
```

Preview without creating. Then run without `--dry-run` to create.

### Option C: Manual (GitHub UI)
```powershell
python scripts\export_issues_for_manual_creation.py
```

Open `GITHUB_ISSUES_EXPORT.md` and copy-paste each issue into GitHub UI.

## ✨ What Each Issue Contains

Every GitHub issue created includes:

```
Title:                  Short, action-oriented
Context / Why:          Problem statement & motivation
Scope:                  Exact deliverables
Non-goals:              What's explicitly NOT included
Acceptance Criteria:    Checklist for completion (with [ ] boxes)
Required Tests:         Specific test names to implement
Definition of Done:     How to verify it's complete
Dependencies:           Which issues must be done first
```

**Example** (Issue 5 State Estimator):
```
## Scope
- Project VPD calculation (with formula + 5 reference cases)
- Ring buffer API (add, get_last_n_hours, get_stats, etc.)
- Confidence scoring algorithm (from Issue 2b spec)
- Anomaly detection (thresholds from Issue 2b spec)
- Sensor health diagnostics (fault detection)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] VPD matches reference cases
- [ ] Ring buffer overwrites > 48h old
- [ ] Confidence score produced for each state (0.0-1.0)
- [ ] Anomaly detector emits AnomalyV1 events
- [ ] Pipeline is deterministic for fixed input
```

## 🎯 Key Features

✅ **All gaps addressed**  
Each of the 10 gaps from readiness assessment is fixed and integrated:
- Gap #1 (Observation contract) → TOMATO-2a
- Gap #2 (SensorHealthV1) → TOMATO-2 + 2b
- Gap #3 (Anomaly thresholds) → TOMATO-2b + 5
- Gap #4 (Confidence algorithm) → TOMATO-2b + 5
- Gap #5 (Ring buffer API) → TOMATO-5
- Gap #6 (Device status) → TOMATO-2a
- Gap #7 (VPD algorithm + refs) → TOMATO-2b + 5
- Gap #8 (Orchestrator) → TOMATO-7 + 5
- Gap #9 (CLI arguments) → TOMATO-7
- Gap #10 (Error handling) → TOMATO-2b + 3 + 4

✅ **Specs locked in**  
Algorithms, thresholds, and API signatures are detailed and reference-validated:
- VPD: Magnus approximation formula + 5 test cases
- Confidence: Base 1.0, cumulative deductions
- Thresholds: Soil, VPD, temp, fault detection rules
- Ring Buffer: 4 methods specified with types
- CLI: 6 arguments with defaults

✅ **Phase-ordered**  
Issues organized into 5 phases for parallel work:
- Phase 1: 4 issues (foundation contracts & specs)
- Phase 2: 2 issues (storage & sources)
- Phase 3: 2 issues (estimator & scheduler)
- Phase 4: 1 issue (orchestration)
- Phase 5: 1 issue (quality gate)

✅ **Dependencies documented**  
Clear dependency graph to prevent wrong build order:
- TOMATO-2 → Prerequisites for issues 3, 4, 5
- TOMATO-2a → Required by TOMATO-4, 5
- TOMATO-2b → Used by TOMATO-5
- TOMATO-3, 4 → Required for TOMATO-7
- TOMATO-3, 4, 5, 6 → Required for TOMATO-7
- TOMATO-1 through 7 → Required for TOMATO-8 (QA gate)

✅ **Ready to code**  
Each issue has explicit required tests and acceptance criteria:
- Test names specified (e.g., `tests/estimator/test_vpd.py::test_vpd_matches_reference_values`)
- Reference cases provided
- Algorithms documented with examples

## 🎬 Next Steps

### Step 1: Create Issues (Pick One)
```powershell
# Automatic (recommended):
python scripts\create_github_issues.py

# Or manual export:
python scripts\export_issues_for_manual_creation.py
```

### Step 2: Verify Issues
- Go to: https://github.com/your-org/senior-pomidor/issues
- Confirm all 10 issues present
- Verify labels: `stage-1`, `issue-N`
- Check descriptions are readable

### Step 3: Set Up Project (Optional)
```powershell
gh project create --title "Stage 1 - Core Foundation" --format table
# Add columns: Backlog → Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3 → Done
# Assign issues by phase
```

### Step 4: Start Phase 1 (Week 1)
- Assign TOMATO-1 (bootstrap)
- Assign TOMATO-2, 2a, 2b (contracts & specs) in parallel
- Create supporting docs:
  - `docs/vpd_algorithm.md`
  - `docs/anomaly_thresholds.md`
  - `docs/confidence_scoring.md`

### Step 5: Begin Implementation
Once Phase 1 is done:
- TOMATO-3, 4 → Data flow (storage, sources)
- TOMATO-5, 6 → Core logic (estimator, clock)
- TOMATO-7 → Integration (orchestrator)
- TOMATO-8 → Quality gate (integration test, 90% coverage)
